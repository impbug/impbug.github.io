              <h3 class="text-primary">Types of data</h3>
              <p>There are several different types of data in Python. Most of the time, Python will work out what type is being used, but sometimes you’ll need to change data from one type to another.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Numbers</h3>
              <p>Python has two data types for numbers. “Integers” are whole numbers, (numbers without a decimal point). “Floats” are numbers with a decimal point. An integer can be used to count things such as sheep, while a float can be used to measure things such as weight.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Strings</h3>
              <p>Just like in Scratch, a piece of text in Python is called a “string”. Strings can include letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols such as full stops and commas. They are usually put inside single quote marks.</p>

              <p>In Python, a Boolean always has a value that is either “True” or “False”. In both cases, the word begins with a capital letter.</p>

              <p>Python can be used to solve all sorts of mathematical problems, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Variables can also be used in sums.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Simple calculations</h3>
              <p>In Python, simple calculations can be made by typing them into the shell window. The “print()” function is not needed for this—Python gives the answer straight away. Try these examples in the shell window:</p>
              <p>Addition: Use the “+“ symbol to add numbers together.</p>
              <p>Subtraction: Use the “-” symbol to subtract the second number from the first one.</p>
              <p>Multiplication: Use the “*” symbol to multiply two numbers together</p>
              <p>Division: Use the “/” symbol to divide the first number by the second one. Division in Python gives an answer as a float (a number with a decimal point)</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Using brackets</h3>
              <p>Brackets can be used to instruct Python which part of a sum to do first. Python will always work out the value of the sum in the bracket, before solving the rest of the problem.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Random numbers</h3>
              <p>To pick a random number, you first need to load the “randint” function into Python. To do this, use the “import” command. The “randint()” function is already programmed with code to pick a random integer (whole number).</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Strings in Python</h3>
              <p>Python is excellent for using words and sentences within programs. Different strings (sequences of characters) can be joined together, or individual parts of them can be selected and pulled out.</p>

              <p>A string might include letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces. These are all called characters. Strings can be placed in variables.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Adding strings</h3>
              <p>Adding two numbers together creates a new number. In the same way, when two strings are added together, one string simply joins on to the other one.</p>
              <p>Adding strings together: The “+” symbol joins one string to another. and the answer becomes the variable “c”</p>
              <p>Adding another string in between: A new string can also be added between two strings. Try the example above. </p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Length of a string</h3>
              <p>The “len()” function is used to find out the length of a string. Python counts all of the characters, including spaces, to give the total number of characters in a string.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Numbering the characters</h3>
              <p>Each character in a string is allocated a number according to its position. This position number can be used to look at individual letters or symbols, or to pull them out of a string.</p>
              <p>Count begins from zero: When counting the positions, Python starts at 0. The second character is in position 1, the third in position 2, and so on.</p>
              <p>Counting the characters: The position number is called an “index”. It can be used to pull out a particular letter from a string.</p>
              <p>“Slicing”: Two indexes can be used to pull out a part of the string or “slice” it. The letter in the last position isn’t included.</p>
              <p>From the start or the end: If you leave off the start or end index, Python will automatically use the first or the last character of the string.</p>

              <h3 class="text-primary">Apostrophes</h3>
              <p>Strings can go in single or double quotation marks. However, the string should start and end with the same type of quotation mark. This book uses single quotes. But what happens if you want to use an apostrophe in your string?</p>
              <p> Escaping the apostrophe: So Python doesn’t read an apostrophe as the end of the string, type a “\” before it. This is called “escaping” it.</p>
